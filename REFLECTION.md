# Reflection – My Data Journal

## Were your predictions right?

Some of them were! I predicted that Wednesday would have the most screen time, and it did (8 hours). I also thought Sunday might have the best focus, and that was true too. But I was surprised that caffeine didn’t really help. The days I drank the most caffeine had lower focus scores.

## What surprised you?

I thought more caffeine would improve my focus, but the data showed the opposite. The days with little or no caffeine actually had better focus levels. That made me think maybe I rely on caffeine out of habit more than need. It was also interesting that even though I slept more on Saturday, that wasn’t my best focus day.

## What was tricky or rewarding?

The hardest part was writing the function to compare caffeine and focus. I had to break the data into two groups and calculate averages. It took a few tries to get it working, but once it worked, it was really satisfying. I liked seeing real results come from real data.

## How did using your own data change things?

It made the assignment feel more personal and interesting. Instead of random numbers, I could actually imagine the days and how I felt. It helped me notice patterns in my habits and how they might be connected. I think I understood the code better because the data was relatable.
